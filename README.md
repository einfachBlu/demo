# Demo / Testing
Just some of my tests. Nothing usable for Production but some Code Snippets might be useful.
Keep in mind that some parts of the Code or structure are not optimized in any way. 
I am just testing out some things. :)

## Current Features
- ItemStackBuilder (FINISHED)
  - create Items easily including Heads, Books, Potions & NBT Data
- ME / PipeSystem (Work in Progress)
  - used to transfer Items between Containers based on the chip setup
